## Tips for Maximum Earnings

### 💎 Maximizing Rewards
- **Commit more RAM**: 8GB+ earns significantly more
- **Maintain high uptime**: Keep browser running 24/7 if possible
- **Stable internet**: Fast, reliable connection helps
- **Refer friends**: Earn 10% of their rewards forever!

### ⏰ When to Mine
- **Best**: Leave running overnight and during work
- **Good**: Mine during normal browsing
- **Okay**: A few hours per day

### 📊 Understanding Uptime
- Uptime % = (Time mining / Total epoch time)
- Rewards multiply by (Uptime)²
- 98% uptime = 96% of full rewards
- 90% uptime = 81% of full rewards
- Keep it above 95% for best results!

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Not enough available memory  
**Solution**: 
1. Close other applications
2. Reduce RAM commitment in settings
3. Restart browser and try again

### Status shows "Offline"

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Disable VPN if using one
3. Refresh the extension

### Not earning rewards

3. Uptime is above 80%
4. Wait for next epoch (rewards every hour)

### High browser memory usage
**Not a problem!** This is normal - you're providing RAM for mining.
